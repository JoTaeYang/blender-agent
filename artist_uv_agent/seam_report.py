"""Seam Decision Core — reviewer-facing report (RULE_BASED_UV_SEAM_CORE_PLAN §5.3).

The plan's point is that the engine must not be a black box (§8, §13): the reviewer has to
see *why* each cut happened, how much checker distortion dropped, why the island count grew,
and whether the user's forbidden/preferred intent was honoured. This module turns the
existing ``chart_uv_agent.pipeline.run_chart_uv`` result dict (plus, optionally, the
edge-level :mod:`artist_uv_agent.seam_policy` decisions) into the exact JSON schema §5.3
specifies, ready for the Windows app's seam overlay / distortion heatmap / feedback panel.

Pure: no Blender, no mesh mutation — it only re-shapes data the pipeline already produced, so
it can be unit-tested and called from either the headless worker or a UI.
